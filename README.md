# File Sphere AI

Your Smartest Productivity AI for File Management.

Let me show you the AI we cooked that can do multiple actions for file management with simple prompt.
Hackathon project by NEXUS-SJCET cooked on 6,7,8 on Jyothi Engineering College Cheruthurithy Thrissur, Hackathena'24

### Example
- User clicked on any file
- Type "Read this file, summarize it and sent to abc@example.com and delete it"
- AI: Done 😎

That's the power of LAM ⚡️

Our LLM can do anything on files. In single prompt, it will do everything sequentially. And it is faster.
Also it can understand what "this file" means. Because the system can keep track of user interations on UI called UIState and Server called AIState.
